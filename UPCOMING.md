# Upcoming Work

# Possible options for features:
Scan album directory and give stats and details to help decide how to use it with photomosaic
CLI usage (and later, UI usage?)
Rework API and refactor to improve structure:
    Cartesian: x,y coordinates
    Aspect: w,h pair
    Dimension: another type of w,h pair
Define terminology for all aspects of the project: target photo, canvas photo, grid, etc...
Try not to reuse the same photos so much
